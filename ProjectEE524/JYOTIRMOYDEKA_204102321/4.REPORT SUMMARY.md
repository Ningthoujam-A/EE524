                                      :BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE PROJECT REPORT:

HERE ,WE HAVE CONSIDERED THE DATA SET OF "DISHONEST INTERNET USERS " and used THREE MODELS to implement the data vizualization process.

The THREE MODELS used are :

1. NAIVE BAYES.
2. K NEAREST NEIGHBOUR ALGORITHM.
3. K MEANS CLUSTERING ALGORITHM.

Thereafter, we tried to train the data and thereby,used the test model datas to predict the outcomes (in each of the algorithm).

Each of the model comes with certain aspects of pros and cons, with ACCURACY being one of the measures of the MODEL used.


We could conclude from the above observations that NAIVE BAYES yielded a less accurate model compared to the other two models.Also, KNN model yielded the highest accurate model for the dataset.
